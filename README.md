# spaceChallenge

As part of my preparation for the Java bootcamp I wrote this simple application to run a simulation of colonizing Mars. This exercise is part of the OOP course from Udacity.

The software is divided into different classes which model the items the colony will need to survive on Mars and the different rocket types with their properties.
The Simulation class uses methods from the other calsses to load rockets with items which are taken from 2 text files. It also launches and lands the rockets while keeping track of the space programme's budget. The output of the application is a budget for transporting all the tools and other commodities needed by the colonists using either U1 or U2 types of rockets.

This is my first attenpt at OOP and I needed some help from a friend to solve a couple of the issues I've encountered on my way writing this application. The biggest challenge in writing this app was making sure all the methods are in the right classess and that they work correctly. It was interesting to see how different security mechanisms such as privacy keywords and getters can be applied to secure data used by each of the classes. Making sure that the Simulation class methods work with both rocket types without writing excessive lines of code was also an interesting challenge. Overall writing this piece of software had a steep learning curve for m but at the same time it was fun.
